# NCSR-RISK-LSU-UNIVERISTY-ASSESSMENT

 

<h2>Description</h2>
Project consists of an NSCR Version 1.1 assessment that was performed on Louisiana State University's IT Security policies. This assessment is based on maturity levels 1- 7. Based on this assesment, this will determine the overall health of the institutions IT security polices,log gaps ,and suggest improvements to enhance the organizations security posture based on the information this was provided for this assessment. The assessment also provides 10 samples of 108 questions of the assessment with a risk assessment showing the serverity of the risk (High,Medium,Low) based on the report of the lowerest maturity levels of the NSCR assessment
<br />

<h1>Assessment question 2: Software platforms and applications within the organization are inventoried..  </h1>
<br />
<br />
 I reviewed the question "Software platforms and applications within the organization are inventoried." Located the document of the policy and performed the assessment: <br/>

<br />
<br />
The applications are not displayed to the public, but based on LSU's policy statement, we can cofirmed that all of LSU's applications are inventoried and they have standards in place that gives this a maturity level of 6.:  <br/>

<h1>Assessment question 3: Organizational communication and data flows are mapped.  </h1>
<br />
<br />
<img src="https://imgur.com/nVDeMkC.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt=" Network Security Policy"/>
<br />
<br />
<br />
Based on the network security policy, the organization has policies and standards in place, however, there is not enough information that an risk assessment was performed with the information provided so the maturity level is a 4:  <br/>:  <br/>

<br />
<br />
<h1>Assessment question 4: External information systems are catalogued.  </h1>
<br />
<br />
According to the Applications and Cloud Standards, we can assume that all information systems such as cloud providers, application providers or any device used to store data is catalogued, but there is not enough evidence to show if a risk assesment has been performed. The maturity level will be a 4:  <br/>:  <br/>

<br />
<br />
<h1>Assessment question 5:Resources (e.g., hardware, devices, data, time, and software) are prioritized based on their classification, criticality, and business value..  </h1>
<br />
<br />
Looking at the IT Asset Management Statement, we can assume that all asset that store critical data is protected and has standards in place but does not define which asset are critical. Maturity Level will be a 4:  <br/>

<h1>Assessment question 6: Cybersecurity roles and responsibilities for the entire workforce and third-party stakeholders (e.g., suppliers, customers, partners) are established. </h1>
<br />
<br />
However not available to the public, while reviewing the personnel policy, we can assume the the organization has cybersecurity roles and responsible outlined and standards in place. The Maturity level will be a 6:  <br/>

<br />
<br />
<h1>Assessment question 7: The organization's role in the supply chain is identified and communicated. </h1>

Based on the information provided to the public that is not enough information to validate that shows which roles in LSU's supply chain are most critical but looking at Imformation Security Program policy we can ensure that a policy is set in place. Maturity level will be 3:

<br />
<br />
<h1>Assessment question 8: The organization's place in critical infrastructure and its industry sector is identified and communicated.. </h1>
<br />
<br />
This question is kind of non-applicable,due to the fact that is doesn't support manger infrustructure and level will be 2 since it follows education :

<br />
<br />
<h1>Assessment question 9: Priorities for organizational mission, objectives, and activities are established and communicated.. </h1>
<br />
<br />
 The priorites of the organization defines to cybersecurity roles ,responsibilities and risk mangement decisions in the information security policy. There is no record that a risk assesment was implement so the maturity level will be 4 :

<h1>Assessment question 10: Dependencies and critical functions for delivery of critical services are established.. </h1>
<br />
<br />
Based on LSU's DataBase Management, Network Security and System Securitiy policies, they do have standards in place but doesn't define what critical functions are most vital to the organinizations revenue. I risk assessment will need to be completed, so the maturity level will be 4:

<br />
<br />
Based on the network security policy, the organization has policies and standards in place, however, there is not enough information that an risk assessment was performed with the information provided so the maturity level is a 4:  <br/>:  <br/>

<h1>Assessment question 4: External information systems are catalogued.  </h1>
<br />
<br />
According to the Applications and Cloud Standards, we can assume that all information systems such as cloud providers, application providers or any device used to store data is catalogued, but there is not enough evidence to show if a risk assesment has been performed. The maturity level will be a 4:  <br/>:  <br/>
